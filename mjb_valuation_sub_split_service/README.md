# Subcontracting Cost Allocation for Manufacturing Order 

This module provides a robust solution for efficiently managing and allocating subcontracting costs in manufacturing orders.

**Before** 

Subcontracting costs can be complex to manage, often varying with each manufacturing order. Therefore, they are difficult to accurately allocate and track in financial records.

**After**
 
The module helps combat these issues by providing a direct, simplified method for dividing subcontracting costs per manufacturing order. It allows users to define cost parameters on a per-product-category basis and efficiently calculate the divided costs.
